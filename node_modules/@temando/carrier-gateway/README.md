Carrier Gateway
===

Carrier gateway is a library for communications between various Temando services
and the carriers we talk to, or need to make calculations on behalf of. It
defines the standard schema set that all carrier integrations must adhere to and
also provides some helpers for schema validation and working with serverless.

What is referred to as 'The Carrier Gateway' at Temando is actually a cluster of
systems that mediate communications between Temando services and specific
carrier functionality. This cluster is made up of the individual carrier
integration micro-services which all follow the interfaces defined in this
library. For documentation on the larger gateway ecosystem please see
the [pony express tome](http://docs.temando.io/pony-express-tome/).

## Creating Integrations

If you are simply looking to introduce a new carrier to the gateway see the
[carrier integrationa template project](https://src.temando.io/carrier-framework/carrier-integration-template).

The carrier gateway
[integration guide](https://src.temando.io/carrier-framework/carrier-gateway/blob/master/resources/Integrators-Guide-to-Gateway.md)
documents the required behaviour of carrier integrations.  It is a source of knowledge for
both carrier integrators, and developers wanting to communicate with their
integrations.  It also provides testing guidelines for carrier integrations, and
a definition of "done".

The
[carrier integration template project](https://src.temando.io/carrier-framework/carrier-integration-template)
follows the guidelines outlined in the integration guide.
