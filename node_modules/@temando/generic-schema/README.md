# Generics

> Generic JSON schema describing the data-structures of the shipping &
> fulfillment industry.

## Introduction

Generic-schema is a reusable library of JSON schema that aims to establish a standard
set of API components across micro-services at Temando. Shipping and fulfillment
is its domain and the schema it contains describe many common data-structures
found throughout the industry. By using this library you are helping reduce the
overall workload of request/response mapping between Temando's external and
internal facing services as generic-schema provides the basis for a common language
through which these services can _communicate_ and _understand_ each other.

## Usage

Generic-schema is maintained and packaged as a nodejs module and additionally
published at [https//schema.temando.io/generics](https//schema.temando.io/generics).

### node

Because generic-schema is published as a npm package you can easily import it into
your nodejs projects:
```bash
npm i --save @temando/generic-schema
```

Here's a simple example how to add the generic-schema to an ajv json schema validator:
```javascript
import { schemas } from '@temando/generic-schema';
import { Ajv } from 'ajv';

const ajv = new Ajv();

ajv.addSchemas(Object.keys(schemas).map(key => schemas[key]));
```

### www

Generic-schema are published to https://schema.temando.io/generics in `.json` format
for public consumption however this also facilitates porting generic-schema to other
programming language environments.
