### Removed

- Metrics no longer print in JSON format.

## [4.1.1][] - 2017-09-21

## [4.1.0][] - 2017-09-19

### Added

### Changed

- Internally, `timing` metrics now map to `histogram`.

## [4.0.0][] - 2017-09-18

### Changed

## [3.0.3][] - 2017-09-18

### Fixed

- Fix `ITags` typing to allow numbers, as well as strings.

## [3.0.2][] - 2017-09-18

### Fixed

- Fix Typescript function overloads for `InstrumentClient` so they are ordered most specific to least specific. [See Do's and Don'ts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/do-s-and-don-ts.html#function-overloads).

## [3.0.1][] - 2017-09-15

### Fixed

- `DatadogLogMetrics` plugin learnt how to write timing data, using histogram.
- `InstrumentClient.count` defaults `value` to 1 when not provided. This restores the v1.x behaviour.
- Add CHANGELOG controls (`yarn version`)
- Update README so that it's accurate!

## [3.0.0] - 2017-08-19

### Changes

- Internally, `InstrumentGatewayClient` is now `InstrumentClient`
- Both `InstrumentGatewayClient` and `InstrumentClient` are still exported from the library

### Removed

- `InstrumentClient.events` (use root event emitter)
- `InstrumentClient.flush()`
- `InstrumentClient.close()`
- `CollectLogMetrics` and `FlushToGateway`

### Deprecated

- `InstrumentClient.timerStart()` (use `InstrumentClient.timer`)

## [2.0.0] - 2017-08-14

Breaking Changes:

- Instrumentalize lambdas have been removed as `service-library` supercedes them
- Requires `>= node@6` runtime

Features:

- `InstrumentGatewayClient` has a new method: `.tag(key, value)`
  - This allows one to attach global values, tags, to the instance
  - These tags will be supplied to the `DatadogLogMetrics` logger for each event there after
- `InstrumentGatewayClient`'s call signature for has been enhanced to allow keyed objects for arguments in public methods associated with `tags`
- Types & call signatures have been added for most public methods
- `InstrumentGatewayClient` now extends EventEmitter. `client.on()` is avaliable, and `client.events.on()` is also there for backwards compat

Internal:

- Added new export `InstrumentClient`, so as to prepare for removing the gateway aspect
- TypeScript builds
- Jest
  - coverage (>80 lines)
  - Tests for built files
- lint (tslint-config-temando)
- CI is now using latest node image

Notes:

- Types are minimal currently pending further attention
