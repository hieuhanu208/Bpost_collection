# Schema changes

- Use `additionalProperties: false` generously
- Add new features to the test samples (`tests/samples`) to ensure test coverage
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`

# NPM Library Publishing

## Versioning

While we are in pre-release,
- MAJOR bump when a release invalidates any previously valid marco JSON (breaking change).
- MINOR bump when a release allows additional marco JSON to be valid (new features only).
- Follow usual rules for semver pre-release patches.

TODO consider how breaking changes will be handled once marco is v1.0.0... 
Probably `marco+v1` and `marco+v2` should exist within the project.

## Consider `carrier-service` project

Currently, an integration's marco JSON is validated against a fixed marco version 
within `carrier-service` before an integration may deploy.

Ensure `carrier-service` is updated before integrations attempt to deploy unsupported marco.

## Consider `chameleon` project

Support for schema changes must be deployed in the marco renderer in the required 
environments before marco JSON deployment.
