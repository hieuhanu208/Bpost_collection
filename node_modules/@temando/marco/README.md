# Marco

A Marco definition describes a form or a workflow in a way that allows auto-generating of
interfaces within a user-facing Temando app or extension.

- [Guide: Messages](resources/docs/messages.md)

## Workflow

A workflow consists of multiple steps. A user may take different paths through the workflow depending their inputs/choices. A workflow potentially contains more than one form.

```json
{
  steps: [...],
  ...
}
```

- [Guide: Workflow](resources/docs/workflow.md)

## Form

A form consists of inputs/controls which usually result in a HTTP request. A Marco definition may consist of just a single form, when that is all that is required to fulfil the requirements e.g. create location

```json
{
  controlSets: [
    {
      controls: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          ...
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  httpRequest: {...}
  ...
}
```
