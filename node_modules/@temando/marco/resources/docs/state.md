# State

Any temporary state generated by the use of Marco must be made available for other parts of Marco.

## Form

```json
{
  "form": {
    "aFormId": {
      "valuesByControlId": {
        "aControlId": ""
      },
      "requestData": {},
      "responseData": {}
    }
  },
  "grid": {
    "aGridId": {
      "selection": ["a", "b"]
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

### Request Data (`#/form/aFormId/requestData`)

- The Request Data object which is built by the form control refs (see `"ref"` property on Form Control schema).
- Written by the time a user has completed a form.
- Most likely to be read on a confirmation step to submit on 'Confirm'.

### Values by Control ID (`#/form/aFormId/valuesByControlId/aControlId`)

- Each individual control's value, whether or not the value is a part of the Request Data object.
- Written while a user is interacting with a control.
- Most likely to be read on a confirmation step to display an entered value.

### Response Data (`#/form/aFormId/responseData`)

- The response data from an executed `httpRequest`
- Written after success of a `httpRequest`

## Grid

```json
{
  "grid": {
    "aGridId": {
      "selection": ["a", "b"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Selection (`#/grid/aGridId/selection`)

- The grid's selection values.
- Written while a user is interacting with a grid.

## Workflow

```json
{
  "workflow": {

TBC
