# Validation Guide

A big part of any form is validation.
[Form Control](../schemas/generic/form/form-control+v1.schema.json) takes this into account,
with each control optionally including `validation[]` data: An array of validation rules.

- [Date Rule](../schemas/generic/form/validation-rules/date-rule+v1.schema.json)
- [Datetime Rule](../schemas/generic/form/validation-rules/datetime-rule+v1.schema.json)
- [Format Rule](../schemas/generic/form/validation-rules/format-rule+v1.schema.json)
- [Length Rule](../schemas/generic/form/validation-rules/length-rule+v1.schema.json)
- [Must Match Rule](../schemas/generic/form/validation-rules/must-match-rule+v1.schema.json)
- [Number Rule](../schemas/generic/form/validation-rules/number-rule+v1.schema.json)
- [Required Rule](../schemas/generic/form/validation-rules/required-rule+v1.schema.json)

Below are a couple of samples of validation rules. Notice how each rule has different potential validation
failure messages. These are always required.

## Sample Date Rule

```json
{
  "rule": "date",
  "messages": {
    "notValidDate": {
      "messageKey": "common.date.notValid"
    }
  }
}
```

## Sample Length Rule

```json
{
  "rule": "length",
  "exact": 5,
  "messages": {
    "notExact": {
      "messageKey": "common.validation.length.notExact",
      "data": {
        "title": "ZIP",
        "requiredExact": 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Also notice that messages sometimes have placeholders for required `data`
(following ICU Message syntax, see the [Messages Guide](messages.md) for more info).

Here is what the message may look like for this rule.

```json
{
  "common.validation.length.notExact":
    "{title} must be {requiredExact, plural,
      =0 {blank}
      one {1 character long}
      other {{requiredExact} characters long}
    }."
}
```

Which would render as `"ZIP must be 5 characters long."`
