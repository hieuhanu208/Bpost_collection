# Workflow Guide

```json
{
  steps: [...],
  ...
}
```

A workflow consists of multiple steps. A user may take different paths through the workflow depending their inputs/choices. A workflow potentially contains more than one form.

- [Schema: Workflow](../schemas/generic/workflow/workflow+v1.schema.json)
- [Sample: Carrier registration workflow](../samples/sample-marco-workflow-carrier-registration.json)
- [Sample: User registration workflow](../samples/sample-marco-user-registration.json)

## Steps

- The first step in the `steps` array is presented to the user first. From then, the next step is always defined under `next`.

- When the `next` has a 'done' flag (i.e. `{ done: true }`), this marks the end of the workflow. The implementor determines where the user should be routed to when a workflow ends.

### Step type: Binary Choice

- A step which is a `true` / `false` choice for a user to continue on to one of two possible next steps.

### Step type: Form

- A step which is a form to accept user input.

- When the user attempts to continue to the next step, validation and form submission should be triggered (unless the form doesn't include a HTTP request, then only validation is triggered). On success, they continue to whatever is `next`.

### Step type: Grid

- A step which is a grid for data display, selection and action.

### Step type: Notice

- A step which is a notice message to communicate to the user.
