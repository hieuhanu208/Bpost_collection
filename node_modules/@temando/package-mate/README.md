Package Mate
====

Package Mate is a utility npm package for dealing with Temando package objects
when developing integrations for Carrier Gateway.

It allows you to augment the standard Temando package object with some
convenience methods for handling common operations such as normalizing package
weight and dimensions.

## Quick Start

```
npm install @temando/package-mate --save
```

Then in your source code:

```
import packageMate from '@temando/package-mate';


// ... stuff omitted

const pkgs = request.packages.map(packageMate);

pkgs[0].normaliseWeight('kg'); // to kilograms
pkgs[0].normalizeDimensions('in'); // to inches
```
