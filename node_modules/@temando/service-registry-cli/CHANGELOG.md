## Unreleased

## [v0.4.0] - 2017-06-04

### Changed

- Upgraded to `@temando/service-registry-lib` version v0.7.0 to include YAML support

## [v0.3.2] - 2017-04-03

### Changed

- `registry kv` will now just return the value of the specified kv.

    ```sh
    # v0.3.2
    $ registry kv get message -e teststage
    Hello World
    # v0.3.1
    $ registry kv get message -e teststage
    message: Hello World`
    ```


## [v0.3.1] - 2016-12-14

### Fixed

- Allow installation on engines higher than Node 4.3.2 (Lambda), rather than requiring this exact version.

## [v0.3.0] - 2016-12-08

### Added

- `registry catalog` learnt a new command, `search`, which supports exact matching on service attributes. Run `registry catalog search --help` for more information.
- All registry commands (except `watch`) learnt the `--profile` argument which accepts the name of your AWS profile as defined in your `~/.aws/credentials` file. This offers an alternative to exporting credentials to run Service Registry as different users.

### Changed

- Remove unrequired `devDependencies` from this project
