## Unreleased

## [v0.7.1] - 2017-07-07

### Added

- CloudFormation output variables in service-definition schema. Pattern is something like: `${somethingOutput}`
- Additional unit tests for the schema change.

### Fixed

- Used `babel-preset-env` instead of `es2015-node4`.

## [v0.7.0] - 2017-06-03

### Added

- Ability to reset Array FS.
- Restructured ts-definition schema for declaring resources to service registry 
- Ability to load yaml as well as json for environment and service definition files

### Removed

- GitLabDeploy Dispatcher
- HttpPost Dispatcher
- Internal EventHandler. This not a concern of this lib.
- EventDispatcher. A poor example of one anyway. No longer needed though.

## [v0.6.1] - 2016-12-09

### Fixed

- Raised `aws-sdk` minimum dependency to [`2.6.12`](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2612) which introduced promise support for `S3.ManagedUpload`. This functionality is required by `S3FileSystem.write`.

## [v0.6.0] - 2016-12-08

### Added

- The `Registry` class accepts a third parameter, `options` which is used when `mode` is `s3`. This allows clients to specify AWS SDK configuration options when using Amazon S3 as the `fs` (file system).

### Changed

- Significantly reduced `devDependencies` of the project (@pham.hoang.le.minh).
- Configure `aws-sdk` to use `bluebird` for Promises (@pham.hoang.le.minh).

## [v0.5.4] - 2016-11-29

### Fixed

- Actually remove unrequired `babel-polyfill` package from the project.

## [v0.5.3] - 2016-11-29

### Changed

- Replace `json-critiera` with `sift`, which removes the need for `babel-polyfill` (@pham.hoang.le.minh).
- The `service-deployment+v1` schema no longer requires the `endpoint` property.

## [v0.5.2] - 2016-11-15

### Fixed

- [#1](https://src.temando.io/service-registry/service-registry-lib/issues/1) Regions that only support the AWS Signature V4 can now use the Service Registry.
- Fix `S3FileSystem.list` which would error when it attempted to paginate through a bucket.

## [v0.5.1] - 2016-11-14

### Fixed

- Add `babel-polyfill` dependency so that downstream dependencies are not broken with the introduction of `json-criteria` in `0.5.0`.
- Fix test suite only working for `Catalog.search` tests.
- Update `eslint` dependencies to the latest available and remove redundant eslint dependencies.
- Replace `es2015-node4` and `stage-1` with the `babel-preset-latest` dependency.
- Add `npm preversion` script to prevent bad releases.
- Add `CHANGELOG.md` for best practice.
- Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with information about publishing and maintaining the Change Log.

## [v0.5.0] - 2016-11-11

### Added

- `catalog` learnt the `search` method, which allows the Catalog to be filtered using [JSON Criteria](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-criteria) queries
